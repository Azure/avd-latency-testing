# Prerequisites
- Microsoft Edge must be installed. To update to the latest version, open Edge and go to **edge://settings/help**

# Instructions
1. Download the [latest executable](). You may get security warnings from your browser that the .exe isn't frequently downloaded; feel free to disregard them.

2. Run the **run-test.exe** application. It should open a window, then generate a **log.txt** and an **output.csv** file in the application's folder. If Smart Screen blocks the executable, select  **Run Anyway** (might need to click on the dropdown to see the option).
3. The application will generate test results every 5 minutes until it's shut down. To stop it, press **Ctrl + C** in the executable's window.
4. Once you stop the executable, you can view latency results in the **output.csv** file.
